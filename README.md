# UFOs

## Overview
<!--Purpose -->
The purpose of this webpage was to view information on sightings of UFOs by building a table using JavaScript array. <br>
<br>In this challenge, the code was refractored to allow users to filter for multiple criteria. The user can now filter the table by city, state, country, and shape. 
## Results
<!-- Describe to dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the serch criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation-->
In order for someone to use the search criteria, a few steps need to be taken. First, the user needs to know what information they would like to obtain. The options to filter are: date, city, state, country, and shape.

Next, the user needs to add the what filters they want to use. For example, Florida was used as well as the shape.

Once the desired filters have been added, the user presses the enter tab. This will give the user the information based on the filter search choosen.


## Summary
<!--describe 1 drawback of this new design and 2 recommendations for further developeme t -->
A drawback by this design is that states can only be filtered by the abbreviation. This can be a problem if someone is not familiar with a certain states abbreviation. 

In the future it would be recommended to make it possible to search states by the entire state name. Another recommendation would be to add the button to search the information as well just incase the user doesn't realize that enter can be used.
